### Original description

OdtPHP is a library to quickly generate Open Document Text-files that can be read by a [gigantic set][3] of Office Suites, including LibreOffice, OpenOffice and even Microsoft Office from PHP code. It uses a simple templating mechanism.
See the tests/ folder for a set of examples.

This repository already includes the changes suggested by [Vikas Mahajan][1] and a number of other bug fixes.

### History

This project was initially started by Julien Pauli, Olivier Booklage, Vincent Brout√© and published at [http://www.odtphp.com][2] (link leads to archived version of page, as it is not available any longer).

### History II

This fork was done due to the fact, that the contained pclzip.lib.php and the contained PclZipProxy.php try to create a tmp-folder within the source code directory. Using suexec or php-fpm under a user without writing-permissions to the source-dir caused permission-problems.

To solve this, the 
const TMP_DIR
in PclZipProxy.php
and
define( 'PCLZIP_TEMPORARY_DIR', '' );
in pclzip.lib.php had to be edited.
